# Iot project

The Smart Water Quality Monitoring System is an IoT-based project designed to continuously monitor the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) levels in water. The TDS sensor measures the concentration of dissolved solids, which can indicate water quality and purity.

[Arduino IDE] for maintaining and developing the libraries and frameworks (e.g.,C++, Arduino, etc.) that played a crucial role in building the IoT system.
[Md Azizur Rahman, Rahul kar, Aman Ahamed Mallick,Antareep shah Roy] for their dedicated collaboration, sharing knowledge, and consistent effort throughout the development process.
[Rahul kar, Aman Ahamed Mallick, Antareep shah Roy] for their financial support, technical insights, and real-world use cases that helped shape the project's focus and outcomes.
[Friends and Family] for their unwavering encouragement and support.
Finally, we would like to acknowledge everyone who has indirectly contributed to the development of this project by providing insights, suggestions, or motivation.

Thank you all!
## Appendix
Sensing: The TDS sensor measures the electrical conductivity of the water, which correlates with the concentration of dissolved solids.
Processing: The microcontroller reads the analog signal from the TDS sensor and converts it into a TDS value.
Displaying: The TDS value is shown on a display for real-time monitoring.
Actuation (Optional): Based on the TDS value, the system can activate a relay to control a water filtration system or alert the user if the water quality is poor.
